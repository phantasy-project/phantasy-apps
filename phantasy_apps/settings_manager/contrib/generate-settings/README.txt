Generate snapshot files for Settings Manager:
1. Modify the script generate_setting_files.py
   a. Most likely for LINAC settings, just modify line 21, 22, 25 and 27
2. Run the script in the Terminal that launched from App Launcher
3. Drag and drop the generated files into Settings Manager Snapshops area
