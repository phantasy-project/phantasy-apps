Generate snapshot files for Settings Manager:
1. Modify the script generate_setting_files.py
   a. Most likely for LINAC settings, just modify line 21 (or xlsx_filepath), 22 (or sheet_name), 25 (or settings_rootpath) and 27 (or snp_tags)
2. Run the script in the Terminal that launched from App Launcher
3. Drag and drop the generated files into Settings Manager Snapshops area
